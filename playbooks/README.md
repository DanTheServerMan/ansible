Overview
------------
This repository represents a collection of Ansible roles and playbooks that I use in my homelab. Keeping it in GitHub allows me to show my work that I actually use regularly, but also helps me migrate towards Infrastructure-as-Code, while maintaining a copy off-site. I have gitignore'd my ansible.cfg files, vaults, group/host_vars, etc. I keep a best-effort example file of these in examples/.

I mostly write these roles and playbooks for Ubuntu/Debian. Any support for RHEL-based systems is best-effort.

While I am my own target audience, if you ever have a use case or want to see something added, send me a message.
